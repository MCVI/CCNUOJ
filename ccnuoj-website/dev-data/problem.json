Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called Haab, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called uayet and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.  The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor. For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called Tzolkin (holly year).  The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau and 13 numbers; both in cycles.  Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows: \n  1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . . \r\nYears (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, : : : , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was: Haab: 0. pop 0 Tzolkin: 1 imix 0 \r\n Help professor M. A. Ya and write a program for him to convert the dates from the Haab calendar to the Tzolkin calendar.  输入格式  第一行一个正整数 nn。  第二行 nn 个用空格隔开的正整数，第 ii 个为 aiai。 输出格式  一行 nn 个用空格隔开的整数，第 ii 个表示 sgcd(a1,ai)sgcd(a1,ai)。C/C++ 输入输出 long long 时请用 %lld。由于本题数据量较大，建议不要使用 cin/cout 进行输入输出。 样例 input 8 9 10 11 23 35 output 8 ","extraInfo":"null","id":"000099","judgeScheme":"1","judgeParam":"2000ms,100kb","author":"pyltoca"},

One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing 310-GINO. Another way to make a telephone number memorable is to group the digits in a memorable way. You could order your pizza from Pizza Hut by calling their ``three tens'' number 3-10-10-10.
